excerpt: 'The scaling limit of the probability that n points are on the same cluster for 2D critical percolation is believed to be governed by a conformal field theory (CFT). Although this is not fully understood, Delfino and Viti (2010) made a remarkable prediction on the exact value of a properly normalized three-point probability. It is expressed in terms of the imaginary DOZZ formula of Schomerus, Zamolodchikov and Kostov-Petkova, which extends the structure constants of minimal model CFTs to continuous parameters.'
