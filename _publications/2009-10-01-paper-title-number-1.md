excerpt: 'In this paper, we construct and then prove the up-to constants uniqueness of the natural measure on several random fractals, namely the SLE cut points, SLE boundary touching points, CLE pivotal points and the CLE carpet/gasket. As an application, we also show the equivalence between our natural measures defined in this paper (i.e. CLE pivotal and gasket measures) and their discrete analogs of counting measures in critical continuum planar Bernoulli percolation in [Garban-Pete-Schramm, J. Amer. Math. Soc.,2013]. Although the existence and uniqueness for the natural measure for CLE carpet/gasket have already been proved in [Miller-Schoug, arXiv:2201.01748], in this paper we provide with a different argument via the coupling of CLE and LQG.'
