## Notes Prepared for Seminars

* [Notes](https://github.com/Gefei-Cai/gefeicai.github.io/raw/master/files/虚几何_Imaginary_Geometry_.pdf) on the imaginary geometry (in Chinese)
* [Notes](https://github.com/Gefei-Cai/gefeicai.github.io/raw/master/files/full.pdf) on the full scaling limit of critical planar percolation (in Chinese)


## Notes on Schramm-Loewner Evolution and 2D Critical Lattice Models (in Chinese)

These are all collected in [this](https://www.zhihu.com/column/c_1296527465138434048) Zhihu column, which are written during my undergraduate studies. The SLE notes can be viewed as a paraphrase of Prof. J. Miller's [lecture notes](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~jpm205/teaching/lent2019/sle_notes.pdf) in Chinese, and the notes on 2D critical lattice models are based on Prof. H. Wu's topic course in 2020 fall. A pdf version of the introduction on random planar maps can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Gefei-Cai/gefeicai.github.io/raw/master/files/LQG_intro.pdf).

Due to some other reasons, this Zhihu account has been banned and I can no longer edit these notes.


## Other Topics

* My experiences on undergraduate reasearch programs in probability ([slides](https://github.com/Gefei-Cai/gefeicai.github.io/raw/master/files/suggestions_slides.pdf), [words](https://github.com/Gefei-Cai/gefeicai.github.io/raw/master/files/suggestions_text.pdf)). Both are invited by the student union of SMS, PKU in 2023.
* [标度极限](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/y0wN6SJDP4ic6MaGbPI8Cw). An article on BICMR's WeChat official account written in memory of O. Schramm, by X. Li and me in 2022.
* [非0即1：网络中的数学](https://epaper.gmw.cn/gmrb/html/2021-05/13/nw.D110000gmrb_20210513_1-14.htm)(Guangming Daily, May 13, 2021, Page 14). A popular science article on percolation theory by K. Houston-Edwards, translated into Chinese by Y. Feng, P. Yang and me.
